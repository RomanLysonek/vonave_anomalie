# Notino Quantity Forecast

Interview assignment: forecast total `Quantity` (`QuantityApp + QuantityWeb`)
for 30 products over the 7 days following the training window. See
`task.md` for the full brief (Czech). The brief explicitly asks for a
**non-tree-based** approach as the primary solution, so the submission is a
PyTorch feed-forward network with product/campaign embeddings -- XGBoost and
LightGBM are still included as walk-forward-validated baselines, since the
brief itself frames them as the standard comparison point.

The anomaly research extension does not alter this baseline recommendation:
the current published policy is the control with `anomaly_mode=off`. No anomaly
truth labels exist, known events are explanatory proxies, and standalone
anomaly policies did not beat the control.
Historical overnight/diagnostic/search artifacts may contain benchmark-target
contamination and are unverified; they are excluded from current candidate and
selection evidence.

## Approach

- **Features**: cyclic calendar encodings (day-of-week/month/day-of-year/
  week-of-year), campaign/discount/price info, price relative to a
  product's own historical median, separate first-row/first-available
  lifecycle clocks, and rolling mean/std/median demand lags (7/14/28 days).
  Calendar gaps, observed stockouts, and valid available observations are
  represented separately rather than being collapsed into one rate.
- **Categorical handling**: `CampaignSubTypeWeb/App` are category codes
  (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16, 18, 19), not an ordinal scale, so they're fed
  through embedding layers instead of as raw numeric features.
- **Model**: an MLP (256→128→64) with BatchNorm/GELU/Dropout, taking the
  numeric features plus product, campaign-web and campaign-app embeddings.
  Target is a **baseline-relative log residual**: `log1p(Quantity) - log1p(target_baseline)`.
  Trained with Huber loss.
- **Missing seasonal history**: annual lags remain nullable for young
  products and early history. The NN uses a train-fitted median imputer plus
  missingness indicators, trees use native missing-value handling, and no
  row is silently discarded merely because a 364/365/371-day lag is absent.
- **Seeds**: random seeds for both the NN ensemble and the tree-based baselines are
  fixed (`Config.seeds`) to ensure reproducibility.
- **Two forecast strategies**: **direct** predicts all seven target days
  from a stacked `(ForecastOrigin, Horizon, ProductId)` panel, while
  **recursive** trains genuine one-step models and feeds each generated
  prediction into the next step's history. Both strategies share the same
  end-of-origin information cutoff and are trained independently. `both`
  mode evaluates them on paired development OOF keys and selects the
  canonical strategy using development-only `conditional/common/global`
  metrics.
- **Training data**: rows where `ProductAvailable == False` are excluded
  from supervised targets. Their quantities are censored from lag and
  rolling-demand features rather than being treated as genuine zero demand.
  Recursive synthetic future rows are marked available, matching the
  conditional-demand forecast contract.
- **Validation**: walk-forward (rolling-origin) cross-validation over two
  labeled sets of origins -- a broader, seasonally-scattered `development`
  set used to make modeling decisions, and a `recent_benchmark` set (the last
  `n_cv_folds` non-overlapping 7-day blocks, a pseudo-test check) as
  a final benchmark of recent performance. Each fold trains only on data
  strictly before its evaluation block, so the reported metrics mirror the
  real deployment scenario (no early-stopping on the eval fold, no leakage).
- **Baselines**: XGBoost and LightGBM support both direct and recursive
  contracts. Dynamic Ridge is deliberately **direct-only**: its recursive
  feedback was empirically unstable even after numerical overflow guards.
  Structured models use native categorical support or one-hot encoding as
  appropriate.
  **NeuralNet** and **Dynamic Ridge** predict a baseline-relative log residual, 
  while **XGBoost** and **LightGBM** predict `log1p(Quantity)` directly. 
  Two naive baselines are also included: seasonal-naive (value from 7 days prior) 
  and a 28-day moving average. All are evaluated on the same folds and the same 
  **common population** of rows where every model produced a valid prediction.
- **Evaluation Regimes**: **Conditional Demand** (only days where the product
  was available in stock) is the primary evaluation regime, as it measures the
  true demand the model is meant to capture. **Realized Sales** (all days,
  including stockouts) is available as a diagnostic toggle.
- **Final submission**: by default, an ensemble of three NN seeds trained
  under the development-selected direct or recursive strategy. XGBoost,
  LightGBM and Dynamic Ridge remain comparison models unless
  `--submission-model` explicitly selects otherwise.

## Tier C0 data-alignment gate

The current source includes the pre-ablation C0 corrections:

- separate lifecycle, calendar-gap and unavailable-state features;
- annual-lag imputation and explicit missingness indicators instead of
  complete-case deletion;
- Dynamic Ridge marked direct-only;
- winter/test-like, regular and holiday-event validation strata;
- optional test-aligned development selection;
- both development and recent-benchmark horizon summaries;
- fallback, non-finite and catastrophic-guard diagnostics;
- three frozen `FINAL_AUDIT_ORIGINS` that normal runs never execute.

After applying this source revision, regenerate outputs before quoting new
metrics; the checked-in tables may still describe the pre-C0 baseline.

## Archived pre-C0 results (walk-forward CV, Conditional Demand)

The table below is retained only as historical context from the pre-C0
`recent_benchmark` run. Regenerate all artifacts before presenting C0 metrics:

| model         |   MAE |  RMSE |   MAPE |
|---------------|------:|------:|-------:|
| NeuralNet     |  9.60 | 13.89 |  74.7% |
| XGBoost       |  7.85 | 12.26 |  55.0% |
| LightGBM      |  7.79 | 11.86 |  55.7% |
| SeasonalNaive | 23.27 | 34.62 | 214.6% |
| MovingAvg28   | 37.17 | 49.97 | 509.3% |

Honest result: the tree baselines actually edge out the neural net here on
raw error (though all three comfortably beat the naive baselines -- **NN is
+58.8%** MAE better than seasonal-naive). This is unsurprising on a small,
tabular, ~50k-row dataset -- exactly the regime the task brief itself says
trees are the standard choice for. The NN remains the submission because the
brief explicitly asked for a non-tree approach; the tree numbers are here so
that trade-off is transparent rather than hidden. Exact numbers regenerate into `cv_results.csv` each run. Seeds are fixed;
small differences can still arise across hardware/library backends. These
benchmarks use the most recent history available at training time.

## Running

```bash
uv run python ml/pipeline.py         # runs CV, trains final ensemble, writes outputs/ + results.json
uv run pytest tests/ -m "not integration" -q  # fast Python suite
node tests/webapp_smoke_test.js             # optional; requires Node.js
```

Uses `mps` automatically on Apple Silicon if available, else CPU.

### First C0 regression run

C0 changes the feature schema and NN preprocessing, so regenerate checkpoints
and outputs before using the new diagnostics or quoting metrics:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/pipeline.py \
  --forecast-strategy both \
  --primary-strategy auto \
  --submission-model NeuralNet \
  --selection-metric WAPE \
  --selection-protocol global \
  --nn-batch-size 512 \
  --nn-lr-scaling fixed \
  --reset-checkpoints \
  --resume \
  2>&1 | tee pipeline_c0_512_fixed.log
```

`global` and `512/fixed` intentionally preserve the pre-C0 selection/training
policy for a controlled regression comparison. After this run is audited,
Tier C screening may use `--selection-protocol test-aligned` and a separately
benchmarked larger batch.

### Apple Silicon performance profile

The NN keeps a complete fold's tensors on MPS and shuffles/slices them on the
device, avoiding a CPU-to-MPS copy for every mini-batch. This is a
throughput-only implementation optimization: it does not change the feature
set, target, epoch budget, or number of optimizer updates.

A larger batch can improve GPU utilisation, but it also reduces optimizer
updates per epoch and can change validation quality. Do not select it from GPU
usage alone. Run the real-fold benchmark first:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/benchmark_nn_batch_size.py \
  --batch-sizes 512 1024 2048 4096 \
  --lr-scalings fixed sqrt \
  --epochs 10 \
  --quality-tolerance 0.02
```

The benchmark measures held-out WAPE/MAE and throughput, writes
`outputs/nn_batch_benchmark.json`, and recommends the fastest policy within
2% relative WAPE of the historical `512/fixed` reference. The pipeline's
default `--nn-batch-size auto --nn-lr-scaling auto` consumes that recommendation
only when it was measured on the same accelerator type **and the exact current
feature/preprocessing signature**; without that match, the safe 512/fixed
policy is preserved. Pre-C0 benchmark files are therefore ignored
automatically.

Typical M4 Pro candidate order is 1024 -> 2048 -> 4096. With ~30% GPU usage at
batch 512 and ample unified memory, 2048 is the most plausible first winner,
but the repository deliberately requires the quality benchmark rather than
hard-coding that guess.

Manual override example:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/pipeline.py \
  --forecast-strategy both \
  --primary-strategy auto \
  --submission-model NeuralNet \
  --selection-metric WAPE \
  --nn-batch-size 2048 \
  --nn-lr-scaling sqrt \
  --resume
```

Changing batch/LR policy invalidates checkpoints trained with a different
model policy. C0 changes the feature schema and numeric preprocessing, so pre-C0
checkpoints are intentionally incompatible. Use `--reset-checkpoints` for the
first C0 regression run; later C0 checkpoints remain reusable with `--resume`.

**macOS setup note:** XGBoost/LightGBM's macOS wheels need Homebrew's OpenMP
runtime: `brew install libomp`. Separately, PyTorch bundles its *own* copy of
that same runtime -- loading both copies in one process crashes the
interpreter the moment either trains. That's why `tree_worker.py` runs
XGBoost/LightGBM (`models/xgboost_model.py`, `models/lightgbm_model.py`) in a
dedicated subprocess (via `run_tree_baselines` in `pipeline.py`) instead of
importing them alongside torch directly; `ml/framework.py` holds the
torch-free code every model shares, and `ml/models/__init__.py` documents why
it must never eagerly import both a torch-based and a tree-based model
module together.

## Interactive results dashboard

A local FastAPI + vanilla-JS/Chart.js dashboard presents strategy-aware
walk-forward comparisons, per-fold tables, paired direct-vs-recursive results,
horizon curves, per-product forecasts, and the canonical submission grid.

```bash
uv run python webapp/server.py       # http://127.0.0.1:8999 (port set in webapp/server.py)
```

It reads `outputs/results.json` fresh on every request, so after editing
`ml/pipeline.py` (or a model under `ml/models/`) and rerunning it (or just
`uv run python ml/export_results.py` to skip retraining), reload the page to
see updated numbers. The server runs with `--reload`, and the frontend is
static HTML/CSS/JS with no build step — edit `webapp/static/*` and refresh
the browser to iterate on the presentation.

**Pages:**
- `/` — overview with direct/recursive and conditional/realized selectors,
- `/dataset` — concise dataset profile, finding-to-decision mapping, retained/rejected experiments and known limitations,
  all seven models, paired strategy comparison, development horizon curves,
  benchmark fold metrics, product explorer and canonical submission.
- `/evaluation` — the complete rolling-origin evaluation contract: the
  distinction between walk-forward validation and direct/recursive inference,
  development/recent-benchmark/final-audit roles, common-population scoring,
  test-aligned WAPE, leakage controls and metric definitions.
- `/model/<slug>` — one page per model (`neuralnet`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`,
  `dynamicridge`, `seasonalnaive`, `movingavg28`) with strategy-aware metrics,
  plus links to the dataset rationale and complete evaluation contract,
  folds and product forecasts. `model.html` is shared and `model.js` reads the
  slug from the URL.

Each model's color is its own project's real brand color (PyTorch orange for
the NN, XGBoost's brandfetch.com purple, the `sphinx_rtd_theme` blue LightGBM's
own readthedocs page uses), defined once in `ml/framework.py::MODEL_META` and
served to the frontend via `results.json["models"]` -- not hand-picked or
duplicated in CSS/JS.

## Forecast strategy modes

The pipeline now supports two separately trained multi-step strategies and a
comparison mode:

```bash
uv run python ml/pipeline.py --forecast-strategy direct
uv run python ml/pipeline.py --forecast-strategy recursive
uv run python ml/pipeline.py --forecast-strategy both \
  --primary-strategy auto \
  --submission-model NeuralNet \
  --selection-metric WAPE \
  --selection-protocol global
```

- **Direct** trains on the stacked `(ForecastOrigin, Horizon, ProductId)`
  panel and predicts the complete seven-day horizon in one batch.
- **Recursive** trains genuine one-step models and then predicts one day at a
  time, appending each prediction to history before building the next step.
- **Both** evaluates and exports both strategies independently. Automatic
  strategy selection defaults to development OOF metrics from the
  `conditional/common/global` population. `--selection-protocol test-aligned`
  instead uses frozen winter/regular/event stratum weights. The recent
  benchmark is reporting only and never changes the selection.

NeuralNet, XGBoost, and LightGBM are trained separately for direct and
recursive use. Dynamic Ridge remains a direct-only structured benchmark.
Recursive inference receives only an explicit allowlist of future-known
covariates and treats generated future rows as available, matching the
conditional-demand forecast contract.

The unrounded model-strategy forecasts are stored in
`outputs/final_forecasts.parquet`. Strategy-specific submissions and paired
strategy diagnostics are written alongside the canonical submission.

## Interrupted-run recovery and recursive stability

Every completed CV fold is now written atomically to:

```text
outputs/checkpoints/<strategy>/<origin_type>/<origin>.pkl
```

Resume an interrupted run with:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/pipeline.py \
  --forecast-strategy both \
  --primary-strategy auto \
  --submission-model NeuralNet \
  --selection-metric WAPE \
  --resume \
  2>&1 | tee pipeline_both.log
```

Use `--reset-checkpoints` after changing model or feature semantics. Each
checkpoint includes a schema/config signature, so incompatible checkpoints
are ignored rather than silently mixed into a new experiment.

Dynamic Ridge is direct-only. The generic recursive engine still replaces
non-finite or catastrophically large NeuralNet/tree outputs with the recorded
same-weekday baseline before they can contaminate later lag features. This is
a numerical stability guard, not the prediction-cap optimization left for
Tier C3.

## Tier C0.1 recursive stability and Tier C1 nonstationarity

Tier C0 fixed direct-model coverage, but the broader early-history training
population exposed a finite recursive NeuralNet extrapolation above 100,000
units. Tier C0.1 contains that failure in two layers:

1. each NN seed stores robust 0.1%/99.9% training residual bounds, widened by
   one log unit, and applies them **only during recursive inference**;
2. the generic recursive engine uses a broad last-resort numerical limit of
   `max(10_000, 50 × observed pre-origin product maximum)` and never lets a
   generated prediction inflate its own next-step limit.

These are numerical/extrapolation guards, not an ordinary demand cap. Direct
predictions remain uncapped. Recursive artifacts now expose residual-guard,
raw-residual, safety-limit, fallback, non-finite and catastrophic-guard
statistics, including per-origin summaries.

Run the reduced real-data C0.1 check before the C1 screen:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/run_c01_recursive_check.py \
  --strict \
  2>&1 | tee pipeline_c01_recursive_check.log
```

The check trains one seed for four representative recursive folds. It fails
with a non-zero exit status if predictions are non-finite, exceed the broad
safety envelope, or remain dominated by an explosion.

### C1 controls

The pipeline now supports four orthogonal nonstationarity controls:

```text
--training-window-days all|730|365|...
--recency-half-life-days none|365|180|90|...
--baseline-variant lag7|weighted_4321|weighted_8421|weekday_median
--trend-features on|off
```

History windows filter supervised target rows while leaving earlier history
available for leakage-safe lag construction. Exponential half-life weights
are normalised to mean one and are passed consistently to the NN, XGBoost,
LightGBM and Dynamic Ridge training objectives.

The optional trend group contains:

- absolute target calendar time;
- 7-day/28-day and 14-day/28-day log-level ratios;
- latest-demand/28-day log-level ratio;
- 7-day and 28-day log-demand slopes;
- a robust annual reference from lags 364/365/371;
- baseline-versus-annual log ratio and annual-reference missingness.

### Staged C1 screen

Do not launch a full Cartesian search. The dedicated runner evaluates a
controlled direct-only screen using one seed, 12 epochs, batch 2048/fixed and
four stratified origins. It executes:

1. recency window/half-life candidates;
2. baseline variants around the recency winner;
3. trend features off/on around the preceding winner.

Start a fresh screen with:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/run_c1_screening.py \
  --reset \
  2>&1 | tee pipeline_c1_screening.log
```

If interrupted, preserve completed candidate-fold checkpoints:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/run_c1_screening.py \
  --resume \
  2>&1 | tee -a pipeline_c1_screening.log
```

Outputs:

```text
outputs/c1_screening/c1_screening_results.csv
outputs/c1_screening/recommendation.json
outputs/c1_screening/candidate_oof/*.csv
outputs/c1_screening/checkpoints/
```

The recommendation is selected by test-aligned NeuralNet WAPE, subject to a
3% broad-development WAPE quality guard against the identical-runtime control.
The screen is a ranking experiment, not a final reported benchmark.

The runner prints two full-confirmation commands. The first intentionally
resets the old full-pipeline checkpoints; after an interruption, use the
separate resume command and do **not** reset them again. The confirmation uses
all direct development and recent-benchmark origins, three seeds, 30 CV epochs
and the statistically controlled `512/fixed` policy.

A recommendation can also be applied manually:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/pipeline.py \
  --forecast-strategy direct \
  --primary-strategy direct \
  --submission-model NeuralNet \
  --selection-metric WAPE \
  --selection-protocol test-aligned \
  --c1-config outputs/c1_screening/recommendation.json \
  --nn-batch-size 512 \
  --nn-lr-scaling fixed \
  --reset-checkpoints \
  2>&1 | tee pipeline_c1_direct_512_fixed.log
```

After an interrupted confirmation run:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/pipeline.py \
  --forecast-strategy direct \
  --primary-strategy direct \
  --submission-model NeuralNet \
  --selection-metric WAPE \
  --selection-protocol test-aligned \
  --c1-config outputs/c1_screening/recommendation.json \
  --nn-batch-size 512 \
  --nn-lr-scaling fixed \
  --resume \
  2>&1 | tee -a pipeline_c1_direct_512_fixed.log
```

The final C1 candidate should be compared with the frozen C0 direct baseline
before C2 feature-group work begins. Recursive strategy robustness is checked
later for the winning data-aware configuration rather than doubling every C1
experiment.

## Tier C2 semantic feature-group ablations

The confirmed C1 half-life-365 run improved recent-benchmark NeuralNet WAPE,
but its broad-development WAPE was slightly worse and its test-aligned score
was effectively tied with the C0 baseline. C2 therefore does not silently
assume that 365 days is universally optimal: after selecting semantic groups,
the screening runner rechecks the winning representation under no recency
decay and a 90-day half-life.

C2 features are disabled by default. Enable named groups with:

```text
--c2-feature-groups none|all|price,campaign,lifecycle,market,event
```

The groups are:

- **price**: target list/effective price relative to the observed origin,
  lag-7 price and recent 28-day product median, plus app-vs-web effective-price
  advantage;
- **campaign**: web/app campaign-active flags, app-only incentives, subtype
  agreement, positive discount with subtype `-1`, and app discount advantage;
- **lifecycle**: current availability/gap state, consecutive unavailability,
  days since the last observed row, cumulative observed/available history and
  reavailability;
- **market**: leakage-safe aggregate demand known at the forecast origin and
  future-known cross-sectional campaign/discount intensity for the target day;
- **event**: deterministic distance/proximity to Black Friday, Christmas,
  Valentine's Day and Mother's Day, plus Black-Friday/Christmas/New-Year
  windows.

Market demand features use quantities only through the origin. Target-date
market features use campaign, discount and price covariates only; they never
use target quantities.

### Staged C2 screen

Run the direct-first screen from the confirmed C1 policy:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/run_c2_screening.py \
  --reset \
  2>&1 | tee pipeline_c2_screening.log
```

The runner evaluates every group individually, then performs forward selection
around the best eligible candidate. A candidate must retain full coverage and
stay within the broad-development WAPE guard. It finally evaluates the selected
semantic representation under the C1 half-life sensitivity policies.

Resume an interrupted screen without deleting completed folds:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/run_c2_screening.py \
  --resume \
  2>&1 | tee -a pipeline_c2_screening.log
```

Artifacts:

```text
outputs/c2_screening/c2_screening_results.csv
outputs/c2_screening/recommendation.json
outputs/c2_screening/candidate_oof/*.csv
outputs/c2_screening/checkpoints/
```

The recommendation JSON contains separate fresh and resume commands for the
full `512/fixed`, three-seed direct confirmation. The winning data-aware
configuration is checked under `both` strategies only after C2/C3 choices are
frozen; recursive execution is not duplicated across every semantic ablation.

## Combined Tier C3 objectives and Tier C4 channel model

The C2 screen selected all five semantic groups. No recency decay and the
365-day half-life were effectively tied for the NeuralNet, so the combined
C3/C4 runner carries both policies into one final sensitivity gate instead of
requiring a separate full C2 confirmation first.

C3 evaluates:

- NeuralNet total-demand loss: Huber, MSE, Huber/MSE mixture, and Log-Cosh;
- NeuralNet target: baseline-relative `log1p` residual or raw `log1p` demand;
- XGBoost/LightGBM target: raw `log1p`, baseline-relative residual, or Tweedie,
  selected independently for each tree family.

C4 adds an optional leakage-safe channel state:

- current and lag-7 app share;
- volume-weighted 7/28-day app share;
- recent-versus-long app-share movement;
- recent app/web quantity levels;
- an auxiliary app-share head sharing the total-demand representation.

Total quantity remains the submitted target. The auxiliary head is selected
only when it materially improves total-demand validation within the broad-WAPE
guard. App-share error is a diagnostic/tiebreaker, never a substitute for total
forecast quality. Recursive inference feeds the predicted share back into
synthetic app/web history; models without a share head use the observed recent
28-day mix rather than an all-app placeholder.

### Fast C3/C4 screen

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/run_c34_screening.py \
  --reset \
  2>&1 | tee pipeline_c34_screening.log
```

The runner is substantially faster than C2 because NN candidates skip all
structured models. Statistically identical NN configurations are reused in
memory, and XGBoost/LightGBM are trained only for the three tree target
formulations. Screening uses four stratified origins, one seed, 12
epochs, and batch `2048/fixed`. Every stage retains its control unless the
candidate improves test-aligned WAPE by at least 0.2% relative while remaining
inside the 3% broad-development guard.

Resume without deleting completed candidate folds:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/run_c34_screening.py \
  --resume \
  2>&1 | tee -a pipeline_c34_screening.log
```

Artifacts:

The recommendation contains the one full direct `512/fixed`, three-seed
confirmation command. That single confirmation jointly validates the selected
C2 features, C3 objective, and C4 channel formulation before Tier C5 ensemble
fitting.

## Tier C5 constrained OOF ensemble and Tier C6 delivery

Tier C5 fits a convex blend only after the member models have produced full
walk-forward predictions. The default members are NeuralNet, XGBoost, and
LightGBM. For each available strategy, the ensemble:

- uses development OOF rows only for fitting;
- requires the common conditional-demand population across all members;
- minimizes the frozen test-aligned stratum-weighted WAPE;
- constrains every weight to be nonnegative and all weights to sum to one;
- performs a deterministic exhaustive simplex search (1% grid by default);
- applies the frozen weights unchanged to the recent benchmark and final test;
- records recent-benchmark confirmation but never refits from that benchmark.

Enable it with:

```text
--ensemble on
--ensemble-models NeuralNet,XGBoost,LightGBM
--ensemble-grid-step 0.01
```

The pipeline writes:

```text
outputs/ensemble_weights.json
outputs/ensemble_weights.csv
outputs/ensemble_comparison.csv
outputs/submission_ensemble.csv
outputs/per_product_summary.csv
outputs/top_decile_summary.csv
outputs/top_error_rows.csv
outputs/ablation_showcase.csv
```

The canonical task submission may remain NeuralNet while the unrounded and
rounded ensemble forecasts are preserved as separate artifacts. With
`--submission-model auto`, an ensemble is eligible only after it clears the
minimum development gain and recent-benchmark tolerance.

### Combined C3/C4 confirmation and C5 fit

Run the selected C3/C4 configuration once and fit C5 from that same full OOF
run rather than performing another duplicate training pass:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/pipeline.py \
  --forecast-strategy direct \
  --primary-strategy direct \
  --submission-model NeuralNet \
  --selection-metric WAPE \
  --selection-protocol test-aligned \
  --training-window-days all \
  --recency-half-life-days none \
  --baseline-variant weighted_4321 \
  --trend-features off \
  --c2-feature-groups price,campaign,lifecycle,market,event \
  --c34-config outputs/c34_screening/recommendation.json \
  --ensemble on \
  --ensemble-models NeuralNet,XGBoost,LightGBM \
  --nn-batch-size 512 \
  --nn-lr-scaling fixed \
  --reset-checkpoints \
  2>&1 | tee pipeline_c34_c5_c6_direct_512_fixed.log
```

Resume after interruption by replacing `--reset-checkpoints` with `--resume`
and appending to the same log.

### Frozen final audit

After the full run has frozen C5 weights, execute the disjoint audit origins
once using the exact same modeling arguments:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python ml/run_final_audit.py \
  --forecast-strategy direct \
  --primary-strategy direct \
  --submission-model NeuralNet \
  --selection-metric WAPE \
  --selection-protocol test-aligned \
  --training-window-days all \
  --recency-half-life-days none \
  --baseline-variant weighted_4321 \
  --trend-features off \
  --c2-feature-groups price,campaign,lifecycle,market,event \
  --c34-config outputs/c34_screening/recommendation.json \
  --ensemble on \
  --ensemble-models NeuralNet,XGBoost,LightGBM \
  --nn-batch-size 512 \
  --nn-lr-scaling fixed \
  2>&1 | tee pipeline_final_audit.log
```

The script refuses a second audit unless `--force` is supplied. It never
refits ensemble weights and refreshes `results.json` from persisted artifacts.

### Tier C6 dashboard and GitHub Pages

Every normal pipeline/export now adds:

- per-product WAPE, MAE, volume and bias;
- winter/test-like, regular, and event-regime diagnostics;
- highest-demand-decile performance;
- the largest recent row-level errors for business interpretation;
- channel-share diagnostics when a C4 auxiliary head is present;
- C1/C2/C3/C4 ablation recommendations;
- C5 weights and benchmark confirmation;
- the one-shot final-audit table once available.

`outputs/results.json` is copied to generated `docs/data/results.json`, alongside
the versioned anomaly aggregate and product artifacts. The authored
`webapp/static/` tree contains only HTML/CSS/JavaScript source; `docs/` is the
manifest-owned GitHub Pages output. The static model pages use query-string
navigation and no FastAPI server is required.

### Final C5/C6 confirmation result

The completed direct confirmation run froze the convex weights at 0.36
NeuralNet, 0.25 XGBoost, and 0.39 LightGBM. The ensemble improved the
development test-aligned WAPE by 4.97% and passed the recent-benchmark guard.
On the three untouched final-audit origins, the ensemble was slightly better
on global WAPE (0.299304 vs 0.301079 for NeuralNet) but slightly worse on the
frozen test-aligned objective (0.279737 vs 0.278328). Therefore the canonical
submission remains NeuralNet, while the ensemble is retained as a transparent
secondary artifact rather than being refitted after the audit. The dashboard
shows both audit metrics explicitly.
